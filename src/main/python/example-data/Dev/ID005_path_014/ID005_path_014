Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon and distal ileum, right hemicolectomy:  Invasive grade 2 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming an ulcerated mass (2.4 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm), situated 2.3 cm from the ileocecal valve.  The tumor infiltrates into but not through the muscularis propria.  No angiolymphatic invasion is identified.  The uninvolved colon shows multiple (approximately 30) diverticula.  The terminal ileum is unremarkable.  The surgical resection margins are negative for tumor.  Multiple (14) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  

With available surgical material, [AJCC pT2N0] (7th edition, 2010) 

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings. Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.
