#1 Patient has what appears to be a cecal carcinoma
PATH pending.  It appears to be an underlying cause for his renal problem.  His workup is not yet complete, but we are seeing him just to get him a schedule and make sure his evaluations are in concordance with his disease.  We are here to answer questions for the family and to give them some advice as to how we would proceed.  We are looking at November 23 for a surgical date.  This will give Dr. Collins time to get the patient optimally prepared for surgery.  He is going to try to do some diuresis.  Going beyond that would probably only cause more protein wasting.  While they are doing evaluations, the same time we will get (1) a CEA of the blood, (2) get a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast, (3) get an MRI or ultrasound of the liver since he cannot get IV contrast.  We would like to see him back on the 22nd with those three diagnostic evaluations complete at which time, presuming no new findings, we will proceed with surgery the following day.  Questions addressed to the patient's satisfaction.

The patient was seen off-the-floor with Dr. Collins at his request for newly-diagnosed cecal carcinoma.  The patient is a very pleasant 85-year-old gentleman whom I am seen with roughly five family members present.  He just had a colonoscopy this morning by Dr. Dale Aguiar, and Dr. Aguiar described a 2-cm lesion worrisome for malignancy on a fold opposite the ileocecal valve.  He described it as ulcerated.  It was biopsied and photographed and not removed.  I have no photographs available to me off-the-floor, but we will look for these in the computer system elsewhere.  Biopsy results are pending.
The patient has no family history of colon cancer.  He has no other malignancies in the family.  He has no past history of bowel problems, although he has had some rare incontinence and some loose stools with a minimum amount of abdominal pain over the last month.  No nausea, vomiting.  Nothing for bowel obstruction.  Patient reports he was gaining weight which prompted him to be seen by his local doctor.  The doctor did an evaluation, and as a result of understanding that he had a renal disease, he underwent evaluation for cancer and was found to have what appears to be a cancer in the colon.  His only evaluation of relevance to the cancer as far as the colonoscopy and chest x-ray shows no metastatic disease.  He is status-post coronary artery bypass surgery but, according to Dr. Collins, otherwise seems to be a fairly good risk.  His examination shows appendectomy scar and a paramedian scar for gallbladder surgery.  He has no abdominal masses.  He does have a slight anemia of 11.8 on October 22.
