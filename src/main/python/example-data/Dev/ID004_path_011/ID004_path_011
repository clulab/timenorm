Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, right hemicolectomy:  Moderately differentiated invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma is identified forming a mass (6.5 x 6.3 x 3.2 cm) located 31.3 cm from the ileocecal valve and 7.3 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  The tumor penetrates the visceral peritoneum and directly invades the omentum.  Lymphatic/vascular invasion is absent. All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (8) tubular adenomas with low grade dysplasia (2 in the cecum and 6 in the ascending colon) are also identified (ranging in size from 0.4 cm to 1.4 cm in greatest dimension).  The appendix shows fibrous obliteration.  Multiple (5 of 30) regional lymph nodes are positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma.  

B.  Liver, segment VIII, needle core biopsies:  Benign hepatic parenchyma, negative for malignancy.

C.  Liver, segment VIII No. 2, excisional biopsy:  Benign hemangioma (1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm).

With available surgical material [AJCC pT4N2a] (7th edition, 2009).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled ""right colon"" is a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 12.3 cm of terminal ileum, 45.3 cm of cecum and ascending colon, a 3.7 x 0.4 cm appendix, and 28.0 x 14.3 x 1.8 cm of omentum.  A 6.5 x 6.3 x 3.2 cm ulcerative, polypoid, nearly-circumferential mass is present within the ascending colon, 31.3 cm from the ileocecal valve and 7.3 cm from the distal mucosal resection margin.  Tumor perforation is absent.  There is tumor extension from the mass through the attached portion of omentum.  There are multiple (2) cecal polyps (1.0 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm) and multiple (6) ascending colon polyps (1.4 x 1.4 x 0.4 cm located 2.3 cm from the ileocecal valve; 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm located 3.3 cm from the ileocecal valve; 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm located 5.8 cm from the ileocecal valve; 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm located 7.5 cm from the ileocecal valve; 1.3 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm located 8.7 cm from the ileocecal valve; 1.1 x 0.9 x 0.7 cm located 13.8 cm from the ileocecal valve).  Multiple (30) regional lymph nodes are submitted.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DICKENS.  

B.  Received fresh labeled ""segment VIII liver biopsy"" are multiple (3) liver needle core biopsies (1.3 cm in length, 1.8 cm in length, and 1.9 cm in length).  All submitted.  Grossed by DICKENS.

C.  Received fresh labeled ""segment VIII liver biopsy #2"" is a 1.85 gram, 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.5 cm portion of liver.  A single 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm vascular lesion is identified.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by DICKENS.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Hondo, RN, CNP, k-ras mutation analysis and BRAF mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded colon tissue (block A1).  Upon completion, results will be available in HMSW AmqxWkmm.
