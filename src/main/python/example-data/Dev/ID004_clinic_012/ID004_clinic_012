#1 Resected colon adenocarcinoma (T4, N2, M0)
Mr. Mitchell is a very pleasant 78-year-old male with resected colon cancer seeking treatment recommendations.
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Charlie Polen through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent supervisory note.

Briefly, Mr. Mitchell is a very pleasant 78-year-old male from Kentucky 74857.
1.  June 1, 2010 - admitted with dizziness.  Underwent colonoscopy which identified a near-obstructing colon mass.  Biopsies confirmed adenocarcinoma.  CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis identified a 2-cm mass in the liver, as well as the known colon malignancy.  Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound noted a 2.6-cm mass in the liver, suspicious for metastasis.
2.  June 15, 2010 - taken by Drs. Sutton and Bernie Sutton for a joint resection.  The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy, identifying a 6.5-cm x 6.3-cm x 3.2-cm mass invading through the muscularis propria and penetrating the visceral peritoneum and directly invading the omentum.  There were negative surgical margins, and 5 of 30 regional lymph nodes were positive.  Liver resection of VIII showed a benign hemangioma with no evidence of distant metastasis.  The patient was staged at a T4, N2, M0 resected colon adenocarcinoma.
3. June 16 through July 6, 2010 - Postoperative course complicated by septic shock, anastomotic leak requiring celiotomy anastomotic resection and ileostomy for a necrotic wound.  Also developed necrotizing fasciitis.  Fasciitis initially had a wound vac in place.  Subsequently started packing wound twice-a-day after wound bleeding from vac dressing.  Had NSTEMI due to cardiac ischemia from postoperative complications, required TPN.  Dismissed to transition unit bed after able to be stabilized.
Mr. Trahan returns to the outpatient setting to discuss treatment options for his resected colon cancer.  As described above, he has had a very rocky postoperative recovery with septic shock as illustrated by hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure (which he still is recovering from with a creatinine today of 2.8), necrotic-appearing wound requiring reresection from anastomotic leak, as well as necrotizing fasciitis of his abdominal wound and NSTEMI.  He is currently residing in a transition unit and was dismissed from the hospital two-weeks ago.  He has been seen by Nephrology today who continues to follow him.  He continues to improve but is still very weak.  He has an open abdominal wound which is packed twice-a-day.  He also has abdominal pain characterized as 2 to 3 (out of 10), but this is improving.  He is very weak and does require either assistance and/or walker to ambulate and get up.  He is not independent.  He has a diminished appetite and has lost about 30 pounds since his hospitalization and continues to have poor appetite and weight-loss.  He will occasionally have nausea and vomiting.  He has had no chest pain, shortness-of-breath, or peripheral edema.  He has had no fevers or night sweats.  He has had his ileostomy functioning without appreciable problems.  Normal output with no blood or mucus.  He continues to suffer from hypotension.
