Mr. Trahan is a very pleasant 78 year-old gentleman who presented to his local physician with dizziness, lightheadedness, and weakness. He had some exertional chest pain as well. Hgb was 8.7. Colonoscopy demonstrated near-obstructing, fungating, friable lesion. They were not able to traverse the lesion. Biopsies demonstrated grade 2/4 invasive adenocarcinoma. CT performed there remarkable for 1.9-cm mass near the dome of the right hepatic lobe. RUQ US of this mass demonstrated a 2.6-cm solid mass with hypoechoic peripheral halo, suspicious for metastasis. Biopsy of that not performed from what I could tell. Upper GI endoscopy demonstrated mild antral gastritis. His work-up ruled out an acute coronary event. Dobutamine stress echo was negative for wall abnormalities with stress. He comes now for surgical management of this colon cancer.
