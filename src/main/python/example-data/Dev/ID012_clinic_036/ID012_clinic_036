#1 Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of lower rectum, status-post neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed several months later by an abdominoperineal resection, here for FOLFOX6 adjuvant therapy.
#2 Neck pain post recent port placement
#3 History of nicotine addiction
#4 History of alcohol abuse with fatty liver disease
PLAN
At this time we would proceed with chemotherapy, FOLFOX6.  Side-effects were extensively discussed with Mr. Locke including, but not limited to, myelosuppression, life-threatening infections, neutropenia, tingling, numbness, both acute and chronic neurotoxicity, cardiac toxicity of 5-FU.  I have given him a counts letter to get a CBC next week to assess the degree of myelosuppression.  Should there be myelosuppression noted, we could omit bolus 5-FU.  Other side-effects including allergic reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea were also discussed at length with Mr. Locke.  For his neck pain, I have suggested that we could further evaluate to see if there is any evidence of internal hematoma that is compressing on his trachea, although the chest x-ray is not suggestive of any tracheal deviation.  He at this time is reluctant to proceed with further imaging and wishes to just observe.  I am comfortable with this approach.  I have instructed that he try warm compresses in this area.  The case was discussed with Dr. Stallings, who agrees with the aforementioned approach.  In addition, we feel that since his hemoglobin is stable it is unlikely that there is any big hematoma in that area.  Certainly, it is not evident externally.  I would see him again in two-weeks for the next cycle of FOLFOX provided there are no complications noted with the current one.

Mr. Locke is a very pleasant 57-year-old gentleman with following oncologic history:
1. February 2009, started to experience abdominal pain and bloating with altered bowel movements.  Underwent colonoscopy in July of 2009 which revealed a low rectal mass (fungating, infiltrative, ulcerated, and about 4-cm in diameter).  It involved one-third circumference in the posterior wall.  In addition a 4-mm polyp in the rectosigmoid colon was noted.  The mass was invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  He has had history of recurrent abscesses in the perianal region.
2. August through September 2009, underwent radiation therapy with concurrent Xeloda.  Towards the end of radiation, he started to have hematuria.  A subsequent MRI on November 17 demonstrated significant reduction in the anorectal wall thickening measuring 0.9-cm from a previous 1.7-cm in July 2009.  He elected to wait, and a subsequent MRI demonstrated a rectal mass located at 2.5-cm of anal verge measuring 3-cm in length.  He was evaluated by Dr. Martinez here and advised surgery.
3.  He is here today after abdominoperineal resection on July 28, 2010.  The surgical pathology revealed moderately differentiated, grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma forming a 3.1- x 2.8- x 1.5-cm ulcerative and exophytic mass in the rectum.  The tumor invaded through the muscularis propria into pericolic fat.  No lymphatic or vascular invasion was present.  The surgical resection margins were negative, and multiple (13) lymph nodes were negative for tumor.  It was T3, N0.  He underwent a CT-scan of the abdomen and pelvis which demonstrated some postoperative changes and a tiny hepatic lesion, stable since 2009, likely a hepatic cyst.
Earlier this morning he had visited the emergency room due to severe pain, particularly with swallowing and sleeping on the right-side, in his neck area.  This symptom started after insertion of Port-A-Cath a few days ago.  Currently it has not been bothering him at all.  He had a chest x-ray which did not suggest any deviation of trachea, although the patient does feel that to a degree his trachea is being compressed.  When asked specifically if he feels short of breath, he denied it categorically.  He denies any fever, chills, and currently states that he is asymptomatic completely.  He denies any external bleeding or swelling as such.  He denies any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite.
