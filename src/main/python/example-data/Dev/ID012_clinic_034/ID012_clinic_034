Jul-01-2010 20:38:33 - Modification to IMPRESSION / REPORT / PLAN, DIAGNOSIS by Dale Roberts

[end section id="20100"]

[start section id="20112"]

#1 Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of low rectum status-post radiation and concurrent chemotherapy with evidence of dys-response, but subsequent progression in the absence of any resection
#2 Mild hypercalcemia and thrombocytopenia
#3 Anorectal pain with no clinical evidence of abscess likely related to tumor
#4 Nicotine addiction
#5 History of alcohol use with fatty liver disease.
PLAN
At this time based on his disease extent, we would recommend evaluation by an anorectal surgeon.  I do note that he is going to see Dr. Martinez later today.  We would get a preoperative EKG.  In addition, would get PT, PTT.  If he is deemed a candidate for surgery after TME, we would recommend adjuvant FOLFOX6 therapy (a total of eight cycles).  In addition, I would check a K-ras mutation status on this tumor.  I have advised him against smoking and drinking and have offered help.  He would like to think about this.  He has not made-up his mind about receiving post-op chemotherapy closer to home or here.
Addendum: His EKG and CXR are unremarkable I do not see any barriers for surgery.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mr. Miller Lee Locke is a very pleasant 57-year-old gentleman from Texas 07856, who has the following oncologic history:
1.  February 2009 he started to experience "abdominal pain and bloating with altered bowel movements."  He states that he had a feeling of incomplete evacuation, constipation with occasional diarrhea.  He denied any hematochezia at that time but did experience severe fatigue over the course of two-months.  He did note that his stool color was "tan" mixed with mucus.  He was given some medications for the pain which did not resolve, and eventually by June of 2009 he required enemas.  In addition, per records he had a perineal abscess drained in the spring of 2009.  In July 2009 he underwent a colonoscopy.
The colonoscopy revealed a low rectal mass that was noncircumferential.  It was fungating, infiltrative, ulcerated, and about 4-cm in diameter.  It involved one-third circumference in the posterior wall.  In addition, a 4-mm polyp in the rectosigmoid colon was noted at 20 cm proximal to the anus.  This mass was invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  He denies any history of rectal prolapse but states that he had recurrent abscesses in the perineal region which were drained.  He denies any history of inflammatory bowel disease.
2. August through end of September 2009 he underwent radiation therapy with concurrent Xeloda.  He states that this was given over a period of six-weeks, and towards the end of radiation he started to have hematuria, was found to have urinary tract infection and was treated with antibiotics.  This therapy was given with the idea of neoadjuvant approach.  Subsequently, he had an MRI of the pelvis on November 17, 2009.  This demonstrated a significant reduction in the anorectal wall thickening that was measuring 0.9-cm in thickness from a previous 1.7-cm on July 2009 CT-scan.  There was no tumor extension evident on this MRI apparently.  The residual enhancement in this area was suggestive of inflammation versus persistent viable tumor.  After discussion with his surgeon, he elected to wait since he had had a good response.  He underwent a CT-scan of the chest, abdomen, pelvis with contrast on January 26, 2010.  This again demonstrated continued but improved rectosigmoid junction wall thickening measuring 1.3-cm.  This was compared with the CT-scan of July which showed 1.8-cm thick mass in the same region.  There were no enlarged lymph nodes identified within the abdomen or pelvis.  There was a suggestion of fatty infiltration of liver.  No lesions were noted on the CT-scan of the chest.
3. January 26, 2010, he underwent another pelvic MRI which showed stability of this mass which measured 10-mm.
4. March 8, 2010, he underwent another follow-up MRI which showed that the rectal mass located at 2.5-cm from the anal verge measuring 3-cm in length.  The mass appeared annular.  The mass involved approximately half of the circumference of the rectum.  There was local invasion of the mass through the muscularis approximately 3 to 4-mm.  Due to location of the mass there was extension to the mesorectal fascia with the mass also contacting the levator ani.  There were no suspicious adjacent lymph nodes noted.  He was again advised surgery, but opted against it.
Currently, he states that he does have occasional anal pain and has noticed mucus in his stools.  He denies any fever, chills, weight-loss, loss of appetite, headaches, shortness-of-breath, cough, or chest pain.  He denies any gastroesophageal reflux symptoms.

Head:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.General:  He does not appear to be in any acute distress.Mental:  Alert and oriented times three.Lymph:  No inguinal, cervical, axillary, or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.Reports:  CBC unremarkable except for a platelet count of 148, calcium is 10.4, blood glucose 114, creatinine of 1.0.  His liver functions including bilirubin appear to be within normal range.  His CEA level is 1.6.  CT-scan of the abdomen demonstrated a small area of abnormal enhancement and lobulated soft-tissue thickening in the region of the rectum likely representing rectal carcinoma.  It spares the anterior wall, and there is extension of the tumor into the perirectal fat at approximately 7 o'clock position.  Compared to previous CT-scan of January 26, 2010, there was no significant change.  No adenopathy was noted.  A chest x-ray was essentially unremarkable.  His biopsy slides were read here.  It was interpreted as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; however, the exact depth of invasion could not be accurately determined.Rectum:  There is a posterior rectal wall mass that feels rubbery and is distinctly palpable.  It roughly involves one-third of the circumference of rectum.Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.Neuro:  No focal neurological deficits noted.Heart:  S1 and S2 positive.  Regular.  No murmurs, gallops, or rubs noted.Eyes:  Pupils equal, regular, reacting to light.  Anicteric.Spine:  No tenderness.Skin:  No rashes noted.ENT:  No evidence of stomatitis.Abdomen:  Soft, nontender.  Bowel sounds positive.  I could not appreciate hepato- or splenomegaly
