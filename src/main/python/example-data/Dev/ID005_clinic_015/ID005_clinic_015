PLAN BY SYSTEMS
1. Neurological: Fentanyl PCA for postoperative analgesia. Discontinue the morphine PCA.
2. Pulmonary: Oxygenating well with a normal work of breathing on nasal cannula oxygen. Bilateral infiltrates likely a combination of fluid and, based on the CT from November 15, some scarring as well. Encourage incentive spirometry and subcutaneous heparin is ordered for DVT prophylaxis.
3. Cardiovascular: Continue atorvastatin and atenolol. Restart baby aspirin tomorrow.
4. Renal: Most recent creatinine is 4.1 and BUN is 62. Replacing his potassium of 2.8. For now, plan to monitor his urine output and renal indices. He is showing no respiratory compromise from the additional volume he received in the OR and the acute kidney injury may have been secondary to hypovolemia in the setting of poor oral intake. Intravenous furosemide if he becomes oliguric and/or shows signs or respiratory compromise. He is mildly hyponatremic at 134 likely from the DDAVP. Recheck in the morning.
5. Infectious Disease: Cefazolin for surgical site infection prophylaxis.
6. Endocrine: Glycemic control has been good. He has not required insulin.
7. Hematological: Hemoglobin is 9.8 and platelets are 271. No transfusion indicated. His dressings have some bloody drainage and we'll need to monitor this.
8. Gastrointestinal: NPO for now.
9. Access: He has a left radial arterial line which is needed for monitoring.
I have seen examined and evaluated Mr. Gentner and reviewed pertinent imaging and laboratory data. For further details of the  plan of care including the physical examination, please see Dr. More note.

I have been asked by Dr. Baggett to see this 85 year-old man for management of cardiopulmonary systems postoperatively.

Mr. Gentner is an 85 year-old gentleman status-post a laparoscopic converted to open right hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma. His past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease with preserved left ventricular function status-post CABG in 2005, membranous glomerular nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, he was admitted to Oxford hospital for increasing weakness, dyspnea, and fluid retention. His creatinine had increased to 2.3 and he had proteinuria. Kidney biopsy showed membranous glomerular nephritis. A colonoscopy was performed and he was found to have cecal carcinoma which was felt to be driving the membranous glomerular nephritis. He was discharged but readmitted to a medicine service earlier this week for failure to thrive and worsening anasarca. His creatinine has now climbed to 5.0. Because of the worsening renal function thought secondary to the cecal adenocarcinoma, he went to the OR today for resection of the cancer.
Intraoperatively, there were no difficulties securing his airway. He received 4 liters of crystalloid, made 300 mL of urine and estimated blood loss was 50 mL. He received a dose of DDAVP in the OR out of concern for uremic platelet dysfunction. He was extubated after the procedure and recovered in the PACU and transferred to the ICU for monitoring given his comorbidities. As I am seeing him, he is awake and alert and breathing comfortably on nasal cannula oxygen.
