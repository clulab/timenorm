Final Diagnosis
A.  Colon, rectosigmoid, low anterior resection:  Invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is identified forming an ulcerative mass (5.2 x 4.8 x 0.8 cm) located in the rectum, 5.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin.  The radial margin is free of tumor by 0.3 cm.    The tumor invades through the muscularis propria and into the pericolic fat.  All surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  Multiple (7 of 19) regional lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

B.  Colon, sigmoid, resection:  Diverticulosis with a single diverticulum identified; negative for tumor.

With available surgical material [AJCC pT3N2b] (7th edition, 2010).

This final pathology report is based on the gross/macroscopic examination and the frozen section histologic evaluation of the specimen(s).  Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) permanent sections are reviewed to confirm these findings.  Any substantive changes identified on permanent section review will be reflected in a revised report.

A 5.2 x 4.8 x 0.8 cm ulcerative mass is present within the rectum, 5.5 cm from the distal mucosal margin and at the radial margin.  Grossly, the mass extends into the pericolonic fat.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the perirectal fat.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by KUIPER.

B.  Received fresh labeled ""sigmoid colon"" is a 26.0 cm in length portion of sigmoid colon with a single diverticulum.  There is no abscess cavity.  There are no other gross abnormalities.  Representative sections submitted.  Grossed by RAINES
