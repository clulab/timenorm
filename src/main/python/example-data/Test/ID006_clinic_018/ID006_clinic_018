#1 Treatment recommendations following resection of a stage III rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N2 [7 of 19] M0)
We discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status.  We discussed the stage of the cancer and that the oncologist today would attempt to quantify the potential risk of cancer recurrence.  I will staff this with Dr. Dana Brunner through the Oncology GI Clinic, who will outline his recommendations in his subsequent note.
We discussed chemotherapy in general terms and reviewed the typical treatment schedule, support for neutropenia and anemia with growth factor and potential side-effects which include but are not limited to nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue, low blood counts and risk of infection.

Mr. Bailey is a pleasant 66-year-old gentleman from 12463 98201.  I am seeing him today to discuss treatment recommendations following resection of node-positive rectal adenocarcinoma (T3, N2).  His history is as follows:
1.  Spring 2010 general medical exam and a hemoglobin of 12.1 was noted.  Hemoccult stool testing was negative.
2.  June 2010  colonoscopy which identified a rectal mass.  CT-scan of the chest,abdomen and pelvis showed indeterminate lung nodules and a rectal mass.  A followup CT-scan was recommended in three-months.   MRI of pelvis identifying rectal mass, indeterminate mesorectal lymph nodes, indeterminate; no evidence of distant disease.
3.  June 30, 2010, referred to Sidney Center and underwent endorectal ultrasound which identified a T2, Nx rectal tumor with small subcentimeter indeterminate peritumoral lymph nodes.
4.  July 2, 2010,  proctectomy with coloanal anastomosis and diverting loop ileostomy by Dr. Jackson.  Per the operative note, there was no evidence of distant disease.  Surgical pathology identified a 5.2-cm x 4.8-cm x 0.8-cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the rectum with negative surgical margins invading to the muscularis propria, and 7 of 19 regional lymph nodes were involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The tumor was staged at a T3, N2b, M0.
5.  July 29, 2010, his first day after returning home from the hospital presented to his local provider with pain in his foot.  Ultrasound at that time noting superficial clots.  Patient was treated with a prednisone taper.
6.  August 3, 2010, CT-scan due to the fact that he was having increased drainage from his JP site which documented an intra-abdominal fistula that was probably connecting to a presacral fluid collection. A probable defect within the coloanal anastomosis.  Patient was then hospitalized for CT-guided drain placement and initiation of IV antibiotics.
Today Mr. Bailey states he feels relatively well.  He reports that his appetite has been very good.  Denies any nausea or vomiting.  Energy level is improving.  Reports that the ostomy has been functioning adequately.  States that his stool can range anywhere from water to toothpaste in consistency.  States that it is looser in the morning and thickens as the day goes on.  He continues to experience some numbness on the right foot.  He stated that when it began it was from the middle toe extending to the smallest toe on the right foot.  Now it mainly affects the right-side of his foot and heel.  He states that it is quite touchy, almost painful with walking.  States that he is quite reluctant to walk great distances because of this feeling.
He denies chest pain, shortness-of-breath, lower-extremity edema, night sweats, or elevated temperature.
