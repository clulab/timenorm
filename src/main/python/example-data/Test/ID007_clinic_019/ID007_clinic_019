Reviewed colonoscopy, pathology, and doctor's notes.
#1 Descending colon mass suspicious for carcinoma
Mrs. Redman is referred for treatment of a colon mass that is suspicious for carcinoma.  We will repeat colonoscopy on the complex list with anesthesia, given her comorbidities.  Certainly, if this does not appear malignant, perhaps endoscopic treatment could be considered.  However, I am not optimistic this will be possible.  Biopsies will be obtained for immunohistochemistry staining, given her multiplicity of colon cancers and a family history of uterine cancer.  Given her renal insufficiency, we will not obtain CT or MRI but will stage her with a liver ultrasound and a PET scan.  Lab studies are pending including CBC, chemistry panel, and CEA.  Once these are obtained, the patient will meet with a colorectal surgeon.  I have informed the patient that annual flexible sigmoidoscopy will be necessary for any remaining bowel after resection.
#2 Preoperative medical evaluation
Will request cardiology evaluation prior to surgery.  She is satisfactory for purposes of colonoscopy.  Her laboratory studies, chest x-ray, and ECG will be obtained today.
Discussed with Dr. Jean Gonzalez, note to follow.
ADVANCE DIRECTIVES
Advance directive or living will: No, not interested in additional information.

Mrs. Redman is an 80-year-old woman who is referred by Dr. Bradwell for treatment of a colon mass that is suspicious for adenocarcinoma.  Mrs. Redman has basically been not feeling well since April this year when she contracted the flu.  Over the past month her chronic back pain, which normally affects one side of her back, started to affect both sides.  She was found to be anemic with a hemoglobin of 8.5 in September.  She received 2 units of blood, then underwent a colonoscopy September 22, 2010 which showed a "fairly large lesion" described 100 cm above the anal verge, consistent with carcinoma.  This mass was 10-cm distal from her anastomosis from prior right hemicolectomy for colon cancer in 1987.  Biopsies taken showed pathology suspicious for but not diagnostic of adenocarcinoma.  No staging studies were performed.  Unfortunately, Mrs. Redman became more tired and weak.  She actually slept most of the day on October 12, 2010, then went for emergency evaluation October 13.  She was hospitalized until October 16.  Her cardiac echo for murmur demonstrated an ejection fraction of 53%.  There were mild regional wall motion abnormalities.  The walls of the ascending aorta appeared calcified, possible "porcelain" aorta, but no imaging was performed without harmonic frequencies.  Mrs. Redman denies any chest pains or chest pressures or shortness-of-breath.  There is no history of heart attack or stroke.  She does have significant diabetes mellitus, currently on insulin with complication of nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy.  She is legally blind and deaf in the left ear.  Mrs. Redman presents now for treatment of the colon mass.
Mrs. Redman was dismissed from the hospital to Our Lady Memorial Hospital.  She is not on oxygen currently, however was on oxygen during her hospitalization.
Mrs. Redman has a history of colon cancer in 1987 resected with right hemicolectomy.  She had a left mastectomy for breast cancer diagnosed a month later.  Her colonoscopy most recently prior to the September 22 exam was in 1998.  She takes medication for glaucoma.  There is no history of thrombosis, bleeding disorders or anesthesia reactions, nicotine dependence, or sleep apnea.  She does have allergies to Cardizem, lisinopril, and morphine.  Iron causes GI upset.
