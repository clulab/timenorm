Basic cancer education has been provided to the patient at the request of Dr. Willingham  Service.  I have had the opportunity to review the operative report, surgical pathology, laboratory values, and notes in Documents Browser.  I have reviewed these findings with the patient and answered questions.  I have discussed this case in detail with Dr. Johns, my collaborating physician, who has guided my plan.
We have discussed the characteristics of the cancer, including the type of malignancy, size, grade, lymph node status, and stage of the cancer.
Per my discussion with Dr. Johns, at this time recommending continued observation only.  Patient is in the process of relocating to the MI area.  In the interim would like to return to Fairfield Hospital for her first follow-up and then subsequently will have other followups performed in MI Huntingdon.  I have made arrangements for that to occur.  At that same time we will obtain a comprehensive lab panel as well as imaging studies.  Mrs. Redman and her family deny any further questions or concerns.  They have our telephone number to contact us.
PATIENT EDUCATION:
Ready to learn, no apparent learning barriers were identified; learning preferences include listening.  Explained diagnosis and treatment plan; patient expressed understanding of the content.

Her history is as follows:
1.  1987 underwent a right hemicolectomy.  Do not have any further information regarding this diagnosis.  One-month later was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a left mastectomy.  Again, do not have much information regarding treatment options.
2.  1998 colonoscopy performed was clear.
3.  September 14, 2010, presented to her provider with fatigue.  At this time was found to be anemic with hemoglobin of 8.5.
4.  September 22, 2010, underwent a colonoscopy which noted a fairly large lesion 100 cm above the anal verge.  Biopsy was suspicious for adenocarcinoma
5.  October 13, 2010, presented to the emergency room with weakness and dizziness.  At that time an echocardiogram was performed noting mild left ventricular enlargement with an ejection fraction of 53%.
6.  October 20, 2010, at Fairfield Hospital underwent a chest x-ray which was negative.
7.  October 21, 2010, at Fairfield Hospital colonoscopy noting a 6-cm ulcerated lesion in the transverse colon.  This was biopsy positive for invasive grade 3 (of 4) adenocarcinoma.  DNA mismatch repair notes loss of MLH1 expression and PMS2.
8.  October 22, 2010, PET scan noting uptake in the large colon, carcinoma without evidence of metastasis.  There was also uptake in an indeterminate small uterine mass.
9.  October 27, 2010, Dr. Mcelvain performed exploratory laparotomy with an transverse colectomy and Dr. Emery performed a total abdominal hysterectomy with a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  Per operative report, the firm mass was noted to be distal to the prior anastomosis.  Pathology from the colon, portion terminal ileum, transverse colon, was positive for adenocarcinoma, grade 3 (of 4), which was ulcerative, polypoid mass.  Tumor extends through the muscularis propria into pericolonic fat.  Surgically resected margins negative.  Of 27 regional lymph nodes, all were negative for metastatic disease (pT3, N0).  Pathology of the bilateral ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus positive for FIGO grade I (of III) endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type.  It is located in the left dome of the uterine wall.  Tumor is confined to the endometrium.  The tumor does not involve the endocervix.  Negative surgical margins.  Ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved (pT1A, NX).
Today Mrs. Redman is two days postoperative.  She is alert and oriented and able to carry on a very good discussion.  She also has family members present during this consultation.
