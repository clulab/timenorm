Final Diagnosis
A.  Uterus, bilateral ovaries, and fallopian tubes;  hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy:  FIGO grade I (of III) endometrial adenocarcinoma, endometrioid type, is identified forming a mass (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm), located in the left dome of the uterine wall.  The tumor is confined to the endometrium.  The tumor does not involve the endocervix.  Lymphovascular space invasion is not identified. The margins are negative for tumor.  The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are not involved.  With available gynecologic surgical material [AJCCpT1aNX] (7th edition, 2010).

B.  Uterus, cul-de-sac, biopsy:  Negative for tumor.  

C.  Colon, portion of terminal ileum, transverse colon, segmental resection:  Adenocarcinoma, grade 3 (of 4) forming a 5.5 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm ulcerative and polypoid mass in the transverse colon. Tumor invades through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat.  Lymphatic invasion is absent.  The surgical resection margins are negative for dysplasia and tumor.  A small bowel anastomosis is identified.  Tattoo site is identified.  One hyperplastic polyp is identified.  Multiple (27) regional lymph nodes are negative for tumor.  With available surgical material [AJCCpT3N0] (7th edition, 2010).

Gross Description
A.  Received fresh labeled uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes, bilateral ovaries is a 130.0 gram uterus with attached bilateral tubes and ovaries.  The uterine serosa is smooth.  There is a 1.5 x 1.5 x 0.7 cm exophytic mass in the left dome of the endometrial cavity without invasion, grossly.  The myometrial thickness is 2.1 cm.  There are no uterine leiomyomas.  There is a 3.0 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm right ovary with a smooth outer surface and a cystic and solid cut surface with a 9.0 x 0.7 cm right fallopian tube with a paratubal cyst.  There is a 3.0 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm left ovary with a smooth outer surface and a cystic and solid cut surface with a 1.5 x 0.8 cm left fallopian tube.  Representative sections are submitted.  Grossed by RAMSEY.

B.  Received fresh labeled cul-de-sac is a 2.0 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm fragment of pink tissue with multiple serous fluid filled simple cysts.  All submitted.  Grossed by SMITH

C.  Received fresh labeled portion of terminal ileum, transverse colon is a hemicolectomy specimen consisting of 20.5 cm of terminal ileum anastomosed to 15.5 cm of transverse colon. A 5.5 x 3.5 x 0.6 cm ulcerative mass is present in the transverse colon.  Grossly, the mass extends to the mucosa and muscle.  The mass is 4.5 cm from the closest mucosal margin.  A 0.5 x 0.5 cm sessile polyp is identified.  There is a 0.8 x 0.6 cm tattoo area located 0.8 cm from the tumor.  Multiple lymph nodes are identified within the mesenteric fat.  Representative sections are submitted. Grossed by RAMSEY.



Addendum Diagnosis
At the request of Ms. Leslie Nix, CNP, MLH1 hypermethylation and BRAF mutation analysis will be performed on paraffin-embedded ileal adenocarcinoma tissue (block C4); when completed, results will be available in SAWI CuguHadq.
