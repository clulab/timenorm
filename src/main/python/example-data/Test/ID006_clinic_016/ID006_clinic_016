#1 Rectal cancer, adenocarcinoma
Mr. Bailey has had a recent diagnosis of invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which was confirmed here as grade 3/4 by our pathologist.  He will need to undergo additional staging workup in addition to his CT of the abdomen and pelvis that he has had.  Of note, he had a CEA done on June 16, 2010, which was 1.1.  These records will be scanned in.  Subsequent staging will include MRI of the pelvis, EUS with the request to tattoo a region 1-cm distal to the lesion for future reference as well as basic laboratory workup.  He will also have a surgical evaluation in followup with Ms. Barron before that time.  We will also try to obtain the actual colonoscopy report from the outside hospital.  The above was discussed with Dr. Flores and Ms. Barron, and they agree with what is stated above.
Supervising physician, Dr. Flores.

Mr. Bailey is a 66-year-old gentleman with the recent diagnosis of rectal cancer, invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  He was found to have a hemoglobin of 12.1 in March or April of 2010, had fecal occult blood tests times three which were negative.  Had a colonoscopy, he reports, ten days ago which showed a rectal mass.  This was biopsied and revealed invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  Had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which was negative for metastatic disease.  However, it reported irregularity and thickening of the rectosigmoid wall.  Suspect neoplastic change in this region.  That was done June 16, 2010.  His symptoms at the time in March and April were one-to-two loose stools a day.  He has not noticed any melena or hematochezia.  He denies any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, night sweats, weight-loss, etc.  He is able to do his ADLs.  His colon cancer screening in the past has been fecal occult blood tests yearly since the age of 55 which have been negative.  He has been on iron replacement therapy for his low hemoglobin.
