#1 Anemia, rectal versus vaginal bleeding
#2 Thickened endometrium with enlarged uterus
#3 Distal sigmoid, rectal thickness
#4 Primary endometrial versus colorectal cancer
Patient may have advanced stage endometrial cancer with involvement of the distal sigmoid and rectum.  At the same time, it can be colorectal primary.  From a gynecological point of view, patient is not a good surgical candidate based on her age, poor nutritional status, and the advanced appearance of the disease.  We do not have a diagnosis at this point.  It appears like Colorectal Surgery is planning to take this patient for a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy to get a tissue diagnosis.  If patient goes to the OR, we will be happy to perform a hysteroscopy and D&C and do not proceed.  I have staffed this case with Dr. Arnold who is operating at De Paul County Memorial Hospital today.  I tried to contact the primary service.  They are busy in the OR.  I am able to reached at GYN Service Chief pager 734-962-15525.  This plan was communicated to the patient.

Ms. Yount is a 72-year-old gravida 0 who is currently admitted to Colorectal Surgery under Dr. Norton' care for management of presumed rectal cancer.  She was transferred from Reno to his care with symptoms of anemia and rectal bleeding.  According to Ms. Yount, she was admitted to Mansfield Hospital in Reno on October 21, 2010, with complaints of increasing shortness-of-breath, lethargy, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bleeding.  It is unclear whether she is having rectal bleeding versus vaginal bleeding.  She reports that she has been having intermittent bleeding since May of 1998.  She noticed jelly-like discharge and blood on her garments while walking.  She never sought any medical care for this issue.  Actually, she has not seen a physician in the past four decades.  A CT-scan was done on October 22 which showed a thickening of the distal sigmoid and rectum and some enlarged perirectal lymph nodes.  At the same time, mildly enlarged uterus with multiple fibroids and endometrial thickness of 3-cm were noted.  Per the reports, a colonoscopy was performed on October 23 which showed an ulcerated mass at the level of the dentate line.  No biopsy was done because patient's INR was 1.5.  She has bilateral pleural effusions which were tapped, and apparently the cytology was negative.  I do not have any documentation of this.
Patient's hemoglobin was 4.4 on admission to Reno on October 21.  She was transfused with 3 units of packed RBCs, and her hemoglobin was 10.2; it is 8.8 this morning.  She received 2 units of FFP, and her INR is 1.3 today.  Patient has poor nutritional status as indicated by albumin of 2.1.  CA-125 is 210.  CEA is 143.
