#1 Ileocecal valve malignancy
Discussed laparoscopic and open right hemicolectomy.  She would like to proceed as soon as possible.  She will need a CT-scan abdomen and pelvis to rule-out liver metastases ahead of surgery.  We will try to get that today or first thing tomorrow morning, and she could still proceed with surgery tomorrow.  She will also need chest x-ray and EKG. The testing was done and was negative.

She is a 67-year-old female who underwent colonoscopy for change in bowel habits and was found to have polyps in her sigmoid colon, ascending colon, and at the ileocecal valve.  The polyp at the ileocecal valve was large and not amenable to endoscopic removal.  It was biopsied, and it does show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The other polyps were tubular adenomas, one with low-grade dysplasia.  One on the left-side of the colon was tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia.  She has never had colon cancer screening.  She has no family history of colorectal cancer.  She does have a personal history of breast cancer several years ago and had lumpectomy and axillary dissection.  Her bowel function overall is good.  She does have some occasional diarrhea.
